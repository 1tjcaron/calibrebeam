Calibre beam sends your ereader highlights and annotations to evernote! 

Each book you’ve synced with the Annotations plugin (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=2853161) to store data in the ‘Comments’ section of your book’s metadata can be sent in two ways.

(1) Beam all unsent:
Will scan your Calibre library and send all unsent annotations present in comments.  If a book’s notes have been sent to evernote already it will not be resent.

(2) Beam highlighted:
To select individual books to send, you may highlight books in the calibre library view, and click beam highlighted.  This will resend all books

SETTINGS HELP:
You can add books to a particular evernote ‘notebook’ if you like, by entering a value.

You can add an unlimited number of tags, just add them as comma separated values.
